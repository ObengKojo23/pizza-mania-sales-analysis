This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a year's worth of sales from a pizza outlet. The dataset includes details on each order, such as date and time, pizza type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients. Using Power BI, I explored customer behavior, peak sales times, order trends, revenue, and potential areas for menu optimization and promotions.

The goal of this project is to uncover insights that can help improve sales and customer satisfaction at the pizza outlet. This analysis can guide business decisions, such as identifying peak hours, bestseller pizzas, and potential seasonal promotions. It also highlights data visualization techniques for deriving actionable insights from sales data.

- **`Bestselling Pizzas:`** Identifies the most popular pizza types and sizes, helping in inventory planning and promotion targeting.

- **`Total Sales:`** Calculates total income generated within the year, providing a high-level view of business performance.

- **`Revenue by Pizza Type:`** Breaks down revenue by each type of pizza (Classic, Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken), revealing which categories are the most profitable.

- **`Seasonal Revenue Trends:`** Shows revenue by months, weeks, and days of the week, helping to identify sales cycles and potential seasonal promotions.

- **`Menu Optimization Opportunities:`** Identifies low-performing pizzas that may need to be discontinued or adjusted, and suggests potential promotions to increase sales of specific items.
