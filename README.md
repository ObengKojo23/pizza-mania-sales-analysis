## **‚è≥ 3.  Loading, Cleaning & Transformation of Data (ETL Process)**
<a href=#cont>Back to Project Structure</a>

### 3.1 Promote Row Headers üìù
Promoting headers means ensuring that a dataset's column names are recognized as the first row instead of data values.
- During loading the four datasets, the `pizza_type table` had its header row as a data value and, therefore, had to be promoted as a row header before loading it.

### 3.2 Rename Tables and Columns üìù 
After loading each table, checks were made on the table's and columns' naming format. 

- The observation was that both table and column names were in the `Snake Case` format (e.g., orders_table, order_details). I, therefore, renamed each of them to follow the standard and my preferred format for dashboard projects. For example, `orders_table` was renamed `Orders_Table`, `order_details` --> `Order_Details`.

### 3.3 Standardize Data Formats üìù
After loading data into Power BI, standardising data formats is crucial to ensure accuracy, consistency, and compatibility for analysis and visualization. This ensures that Power BI does not misclassify data types (e.g., treating dates as text), facilitates accurate data modelling, enables reliable sorting and filtering, and ensures data consistency across the report.

- Each column was inspected to ensure the correct data format. Fortunately, exploration indicated that all columns were in the proper format.

### 3.4 Handling Null Values  üìù
Checking for null values in Power BI is crucial as it ensures data completeness, prevents calculation errors, maintains accurate relationships, and improves visualization reliability.
- The data quality (`Valid, Error and Empty`) was inspected under transform data mode.
- The observation indicated no null values in the dataset as all `Valid` values were `100%`.

<a id="four"></a>
## **üìê 4.  Data Modelling**
<a href=#cont>Back to Project Structure</a>

Data modelling is the process of organizing data into tables and creating linked relationships or connecting them so that each table can easily communicate for analysis and report creation.

### 4.1 Creating Table Relationships üîó 
- I used the snowflake schema by organizing the data into `Fact` and `Dimension` tables. The fact table contains the key metrics or performance data, while the dimension tables store descriptive attributes related to those metrics. This structure helps optimize query performance and improves the clarity of relationships between data points, ensuring efficient analysis and reporting.

  The table below shows the `Fact` and `Dimension` Tables.

  | Fact Table     | Dimension Tables   |
  |----------------|--------------------|
  | Order Detials  | Pizza Type         | 
  |                | Orders             |
  |                | Pizzas             |

- I created a new `Date Table` (Calender Table) to the schema. This new Date table is important for more efficient and flexible time-based analysis during the analysis. 

  The below DAX formula was used to create the new Date Table.
  ```sql
  
  Date = 
  ADDCOLUMNS(
      CALENDAR(MIN(Orders[Order Date]), MAX(Orders[Order Date])),
      "Year", YEAR([Date]),
      "Month", FORMAT([Date], "mmm"),
      "Month No", MONTH([Date]),
      "Quarter", FORMAT([Date], "\QQ"),
      "Day", FORMAT([Date], "ddd"),
      "Day No", WEEKDAY([Date])
  )
 
  ```

### 4.2 Creating Calculated Measures and Columns ‚ûó
The decision to create calculated measures and columns stems from the questions to be answered and the insights to be uncovered. 
- I first created a measures table. I plan to store all my measures under this table for better organisation and easy accessibility.
- All measures were created based on the under-listed questions
  1. **How many customers do we have each day?**
  3. **Are there any peak hours?**
  4. **How many pizzas are typically in an order?** üìù
  5. **Do we have any bestsellers?**
  6. **How much money did we make this year?**
  7. **Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?**
  8. **Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu or any promotions we could leverage?**
- Below is the list of all calculated measures and columns created
  
  ## Calculated Measures
  
  ### 1.  To calculate `How many customers for each day`.
  ```sql
   Number of Customers = DISTINCTCOUNT(Order_Details[Order ID])
  ```
  #### Explanation of Measure
   - I used this measure to count the number of unique Order ID values in the Order_Details table, which essentially gives the number of unique customer transactions (i.e., the number of unique orders).
   - Since the datasets had no Customer table, I used the `Order ID` as a proxy for unique customers, keeping in mind that this measure will give the count of distinct orders but not necessarily distinct customers if multiple orders are placed by the same customer.
     

  ### 2.  To calculate the `The Average Orders Per Day`. 
   ```sql
    Average Orders Per Day = 
    DIVIDE(
        DISTINCTCOUNT(Order_Details[Order ID]),
        DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order Date]),
        0
    )
   ```
  #### Explanation of Measure
   - `DISTINCTCOUNT(Order_Details[Order ID])` This counts the unique orders from the Order_detials Table.
   - `DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order Date])` Then this counts the unique days with orders.
   - To ensure that there is no division by zero errors, I used `DIVIDE(..., 0)`.

   
  ### 3. To calculate the `The Average Number of Pizzas Per Order`.
   ```sql
   Average Pizzas Per Order =
    DIVIDE(
      SUM(Order_Details[Order Quantity]), 
      DISTINCTCOUNT(Order_Details[Order ID]), 
      0
   )
   ```
   #### Explanation of the Measure
    - `SUM(Order_Details[Order Quantity])`: This extracts the total number of pizzas ordered.
    - `DISTINCT COUNT (Order_Details[Order ID])` This will count the unique orders made based on the Order ID and ensure that each order is only counted once, even if there are multiple pizzas in a single order.
    - The `DIVIDE` function is used to perform the division.
    - To ensure that there is no division by zero errors, I used `DIVIDE(..., 0)`.

  ### 4. To calculate the `The Total Orders`.
   ```sql
     Total Orders = SUM(Order_Details[Order Quantity])
   ```
   #### Explanation of the Measure
    - `Order_Details[Order Quantity]`: This references the Order Quantity column in the Order_Details table that contains the number of pizzas ordered in each transaction.
    -  The `SUM` function is then used to sum up all the values in the Order Quantity Column.
    -  In summary, the measure calculates the total number of pizzas ordered by adding all values in the Order Quantity column across all rows in the Order_Details table.

  ### 5. To calculate the `The Total Sales`.
     ```sql
     
     Total Sales = 
     SUMX(
         'Order_Details',
         'Order_Details'[Order Quantity] * RELATED(Pizzas[Pizza Price])
         )
     ```
  #### Explanation of the Measure
     - `SUMX` was used to iterate over the 'Order_Details' table. Then, multiply the order quantity by the pizza price (From the Pizza table) for each row.
     - The measure using the iteration then sums up the values to calculate the total sales for all orders.
     - In summary, the measure calculates the total revenue by multiplying the number of pizzas ordered by their prices and sums the results.
       

   ## Calculated Columns

   ### 6. To determine whether there were any peak hours, I needed to create two new calculated columns. 
    - I had to make use of the time column under Orders Table
    - Sorting the time column descending and ascending respectively indicated that the `MINIMUM` time was `9:52:21` and the `MAXIMUM` time was `23:05:52`.
    - From this observation, I decided to calculate Time Intervals from `9:00 PM` to `12:00 PM`.
    - The Time Interval Sort column was created to allow me to easily aggregate the time intervals.

    ```sql
     Time Intervals = 
     SWITCH(
         TRUE(),
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(9,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(12,0,0), "9 - 12 AM",
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(12,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(15,0,0), "12 - 3 PM",
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(15,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(18,0,0), "3 - 6 PM",
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(18,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(21,0,0), "6 - 9 PM",
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(21,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(23,59,59), "9 - 12 PM"
     )
    ```
    
    ```sql
     Time Interval Sort = 
     SWITCH(
         TRUE(),
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(9,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(12,0,0), 1,
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(12,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(15,0,0), 2,
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(15,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(18,0,0), 3,
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(18,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(21,0,0), 4,
         Orders[Order Time] >= TIME(21,0,0) && Orders[Order Time] <= TIME(23,59,59), 5
     )
     ```

## **üìä 5.  Data Report & Visualisaition**
<a href=#cont>Back to Project Structure</a>

This is where I jumped to the report view and created all the visuals to answer key questions and give further insights to the CEO of Pizza Mania.
- `Cards`: Was used to display key metrics (Total Sales, Total Orders, Number of Customers, Average Pizzas Per Order and Average Orders Per Day).
- `Line Chart`: Was used to show trends over time (Quarterly, Monthly and Daily sales).
- `Bar/Column Charts` Were used to show The Peak Hours and compare Pizza Orders (Quarterly, Monthly and Daily sales).
- `Pie Charts`: Were used to visualise the distribution of Favorite Pizza Categories ((Classic, Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken) and Favorite Pizza Sizes (XL, L, M, and S).
- `Tables`: Was used to Provide detailed breakdowns of The Top 10 Best Selling Pizzas and Bottom 10 Worst Selling Pizzas.
- `Slicers`: I used four slicers (Pizza Category, Pizza Size, Month, and Day/Date) to allow for filtering the data by specific Pizza size and category, Month, Day and Date of sales.

Below is a short video visual demonstration of the Dashboard for the Report.
